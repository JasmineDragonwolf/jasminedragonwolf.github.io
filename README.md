Was a home for sea creatures in Equestria, such as Narwhals, 


Before the My Little Pony Movie released, at the 2010 My Little Pony Fair and Convention, Hasbro reported that, at the time, there were no plans to incorporate seaponies into the show or merchandise. At the 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 Fairs, Hasbro representatives stated that seaponies were not planned for those years either. At the 2015 Fair, Hasbro reps acknowledged the presence of mermares in Under the Sparkling Sea and the sirens in Rainbow Rocks but still could not divulge any future merchandise plans.

Lauren Faust stated in June 2011 on DeviantArt that she "had a sea pony episode idea, but it didn't get made under [her] watch." She also stated in June 2013 on Ponychan that she "had an idea for seaponies" but "Wasn't sure about it though."

Was a kingdom for the Diamond Dogs, 


### Plot: The Two Kingdoms of Caninia
Rarity, Big McIntosh, Maud Pie, and Mage Meadowbrook are traveling to the Diamond Dog kingdom of Caninia as part of Princess Twilight Sparkle's ongoing mission to spread friendship to the furthest reaches of Equestria. Meadowbrook is puzzled as to why they received two invitations to Caninia from two different queens, but Rarity believes it was simply a mistake. They enter the kingdom via a very fast mine car ride and discover two castles—one lavish and modern-looking, the other drab and old-fashioned—separated by a gorge.

At the first castle, Rarity and her friends are happily welcomed by sister princesses Moonbeam Twinkletail ("Moon") and Ambrosia Muffinbuns ("Amber") and meet with their sickly sister Queen Jennino Lanternlight ("Jenn"). Jenn is very excited to open trade with Equestria, and Moon and Amber give Rarity and her friends a tour of the kingdom. After some pressing from Meadowbrook, Rarity finally asks about the other castle across the gorge, and Moon and Amber reveal it is where their other three estranged sisters live.

Rarity, Big Mac, Maud, and Meadowbrook enter the mines under Caninia, with all six royal sisters seeing them off at the entrance. In the mines, they discover bite marks in the earth left by the turtle-like creatures Moon and her sisters found long ago, which Maud identifies as carbunkappas. She realizes the carbunkappas have been eating the surrounding galena, causing the mines to fill up with lead dust. Jenn's overexposure to this dust resulted in her contracting lead poisoning. To make matters worse, the earth under the old Caninia Castle has considerably weakened over time from the carbunkappas eating the galena, threatening to collapse the entire castle.

The royal Diamond Dog sisters enter the mines just in time to learn about this development and offer to help. As the ponies and Diamond Dogs work to reinforce the earth with boulders, the ground underneath them suddenly gives way, and they fall into a chamber even deeper underground. The chamber houses another Tree of Harmony, with six panels on the floor around it. Just like with Zecora and her friends in the Farasian desert, the floor panels light up when the sisters stand on them: magic for Moon, kindness for Amber, honesty for Indy, laughter for Fiona, generosity for Jenn, and loyalty for Katherina.

However, Jenn and Katherina's floor panels do not light up. Katherina believes it is because she did not show loyalty by letting her sisters' relationship break apart, and she admits she was wrong for doing so. Jenn also takes responsibility for not listening to Katherina's warnings and not being generous with her forgiveness. The two sisters apologize for their past mistakes, and the floor panels light up beneath them, causing the Elements of Harmony to awaken. With the new magical powers given to them, the six Diamond Dog sisters work together to keep the castle from collapsing and save their subjects from falling debris.

With the crisis over and the six royal sisters' friendship repaired, Katherina suggests moving everyone into the newer castle, where the six will all rule over Caninia as queens together. In the aftermath, Meadowbrook cures Jenn of her lead poisoning, and Rarity writes a letter to Twilight while enjoying the Caninia Castle spa. Meanwhile, in the library shown at the end of Friendship is Magic Issue 92, the display of five lights now has three lights lit up, and a character off-screen calls for a meeting of the "Knights of Harmony".
